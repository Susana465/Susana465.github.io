## About me

Welcome to my first profile page (on [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/)). This is a profile in the making, so keep your eyes open for what's to come!

I am a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh, funded by Medical Research Scotland. I am also an Enrichment Student at the Alan Turing Institute.
I want to bring love into academia, into the work that I do. This means I want to create spaces where, in the words of bell hooks, we can be open and honestly express care, affection, responsibility, respect, commitment and trust.

### About my work

I started my PhD in order to better understand how memory works inside the brain cells (neurons) in our brains. In order to do so, I create computer models of molecular interactions that can help predict how molecules are working inside neurons. 

As time went by I started to become more and more aware that in order to create meaningful work, I should make the work I create truly accessible and reproducible. This way, the projects I work on could be easily reproduced and understood both by my academic peers but also by people who might not be familiar with my research.
